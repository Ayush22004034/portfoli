        <h1>Hello, Iâ€™m <span>Ayush</span></h1>
        <p>
          Hi! My name is Ayush, and I am currently a second-year engineering student. 
          I am pursuing my engineering in Computer Science Engineering(CSE) from IET Dr RamManohar Lohia Avadh University, Ayodhya.
          My hobbies include coding, listening to music, watching movies, and exploring new places.
          My journey as a student started from a different place,
          which I think is why I'm always eager to learn new things and grow in this field.
          I started my Higher schooling studies from  Ahilya English Medium School,Mumbai.
          As well my Intermediate Studies from Maharishi Dayanad College Of Science(Computer Science) ,Mumbai.
          In the first year, I chose subjects that would allow me to learn different programming languages,
           which included C,Python , JavaScript, and C++.
